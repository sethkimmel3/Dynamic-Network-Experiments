# Dynamic-Network-Experiments
Computational experiments centered around dynamic networks.

## Why?  
Networks (or graphs) are extremely powerful mathematical models which are used across a wide range of domains. In fact, graphs have evolved well beyond mere modeling tools; they are applied as the underlying engine powering many of the most advanced technologies of the 21st century. As the awareness of their robust and general capabilities increase, we see more applications to solve big, important problems and enable general societal progress. 

At a fundamental level, networks describe the relationship between entities. However, networks are often treated as static or stationary. Even if the network evolves, the interest is in extracting information from a instantenous snapshot. Little interest is given to the creation or evolution of the network itself, and all of the questions which surround that process. 

In natural and social sciences some of these questions might be:
- Why did network form?
- How does the network change with respect to some non-constant environmental factor? 
- Which agents have the most influence on the growth or decay of the network?

In engineering and information sciences, some of these questions might be:
- Can we develop algorithms for efficient (low-cost or high-speed) self-assembly of a network?
- What is the minimum number of intelligent/informed agents required to generate a certain type of network?
- What environmental variables need to be controlled for to ensure healthy network growth?

Finding interesting questions and answers to the former domain could enable new methods, understandings, and designs for important areas of study such as human health, genetics, evolution, climate change, social sytems, financial markets, economies, and more. Interesting answers to the latter class could enable new methods for engineered systems such as autonomous vehicles, satellite constellations, communication networks, digital currencies, generative design algorithms, advanced additive manufacturing, and more.

Through this lens network dynamics (how relationships change) seems even more fundamental to understanding our world than networks themselves (a given state of relationships). That's why I'm fascinated with the subject, and why I've set up this open-source repo for others to explore the subject along with me.

## What are the goals of this project? 
The goal of this project is to take a general, scientific, fun, and exploratory approach to network dynamics. More than anything else, it's about finding the right questions to ask. Therefore, experiments and simulations should be set up to leave the author and readers/users wanting to explore, extend and apply the work. Experiments are meant to be more general in nature, although some may be applied more specifically - especially if they need to be run on some real-world dataset. For now, they will be set up as Python notebooks, but may extend beyond that at some point.

## Is this project affiliated with any university or other institution?
Nope. It's just a private research project for now, spun up out of general interest in the topic. 

## How can I participate?
Feel free to spin up an experiment yourself, make sure it's well documented, and asks good questions (see goals above). Then just open a PR to the repo so it can be added.

## Who can I contact if I have questions?
You can contact Seth Kimmel at seth.kimmel3@gmail.com. I'll do my best to respond as quickly as possible.
